# RemEdi

This repository contains project submission for IOSD HackIsolation by Raghav Thakar and Parth Shukla.

Our project focuses on coming up with a possible solution to the problems faced by the education system in rural areas during pandemic. 

The highly contagious virus COVID-19 has resulted in a nationwide lockdown. This has directly resulted in closing of schools and other educational institutes throughout the country. Several workarounds, such as online video lectures and conference calls have come up as a response. However, it is rather necessary to keep in mind one fundamental assumption, the availability of a decent internet connection.

We decided to come up with a solution, which supplement the existing solutions and generalise them better keeping in mind the situation in rural India.
